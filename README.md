Project Description/ Outline:
	Reviewing NASDAQ data for the Big 5 over the last 10 years, we want to find out which of the Big 5 are the best to invest in either short or long term and contrast their performance against the NASDAQ as a whole over the same time period. 

Big 5 stocks:
o	Amazon ('AMZN') 
o	Apple ('AAPL')
o	Google ('GOOGL')
o	Microsoft ('MSFT')
o	Facebook ('FB')

Research Questions to Answer:
-	Which of the big 5 was the best investment over the last 10 years (largest net change positive)
-	Which of the big 5 was the worst investment over the last 10 years (largest net change negative)
-	Most consistent of the big 5 over the last 10 years (lowest daily percent change averaged over 10 year period)
-	Are there yearly events that contribute to stock volatility (identify reoccurring spikes and dips in stock prices throughout the year, major positive and negative changes)? Are these regularly reoccurring?
-	Based on the potentiality of reoccurring events, is there general good times to buy and sell the big 5 throughout the calendar year?
-	Did the big 5 outperform or underperform the NASDAQ composite as a whole over the 10 year period?
-	Of all the shares bought in the big 5, who had the most shares bought over the last 10 years?
-	What are the closing prices for the big 5 going to be on Aug 31st 2020 (LinReg)? How does the prediction compare to the actual prices they were this year?
